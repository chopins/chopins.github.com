title: 场的内部作用力
categories: blog

1.根据波粒二相性可以推测： __所有单一同源场都存在一个固定同向的内部力__ ，该内部力的作用方向与场的运动方向并不一定相同，场对外部的作用力是运动与内部力共同作用的结果。
由于场的内部力方向固定，并且场的广播性，所以在相对于物体的不同位置力的作用效果就不一样，可能这个内部作用力刚好指向物体，这就产生了引力，同理，指向物体前方，就存在了排斥力。

比如原子内部粒子间的作用力,因为粒子间的内部力方向不平行，所以在运动惯性作用下导致电子的运动轨迹不确定。

而对于大质量物体（比如星球，星际物体间）间的作用力，其运动轨迹就表现得可探测（虽然也在变化，但是由于相对来说运动速度很慢，变化幅度很小，变化就不是那么明显了），同样由于作用力的方向不平行，所以导致运动轨迹不规则，而是整个周期内存在一个最大吸引力与一个最大排斥力

同样对于电磁场，由于内部力方向不平行，所以不同源得存在干扰，而同源电磁场则不存在干扰，且会加强。

另外我们也可以推测能量即是该作用力的表现。比如核聚变是由于在爆发时，能量场表现得十分混乱，其内部力方向得混乱，导致其不可控。之所以不可控是因为每个粒子都释放了不同得能量场。该能量场会对附近其他场产生作用，从而产生力学作用。

而两个粒子组合的一个物体对令外物体的作用力则是它们的合力，当然由于运动的关系这个合

2.假设当两个物体以光速向相运动或离开时，通过万有引力公式可推出质能方程，

1 According to the wave-particle two-phase nature can speculate: __All single cognate fields exist inside the same force a fixed direction__, and the direction of movement of the role of the internal field in the direction of the force is not necessarily the same, the role of the external field force is the result of the movement and interaction of internal forces.
Due to the fixed direction of the internal force field and the field of broadcasting, so in different positions relative to the force effects of the object is not the same, the internal force may be just the pointing object, which generates a gravitational same token, the object point the front, there is a repulsive force.

Internal atomic particles such force because the internal forces between the particles are not parallel direction, so in the inertia motion trajectories of electrons causes uncertainty.

For the force of massive objects (such as planets, interstellar between objects) between its trajectory on the performance of detectability (although it also changes, but due to the relative motion is very slow, very small changes in the magnitude of the change is not so obvious), also because the force is not parallel to the direction, resulting in an irregular trajectory, but the entire cycle in a memory with a maximum repulsive force maximum attraction

Also for electromagnetic fields, due to internal force direction is not parallel, it was the presence of different sources of interference, but not homologous electromagnetic interference exists, and will be strengthened.

In addition, we can also speculate that is the force of energy performance. For example, nuclear fusion is due at the time of the outbreak, the energy field have been very confusing, its internal force direction was confusing, leading to uncontrollable. The reason is not controllable because each particle was released in different energy fields. Other fields near the energy field will have an effect, resulting in mechanical effect.

The combination of the two particles of an object objects outside force to make them work together is, of course, because of the close relationship between the movement

2 Assuming the speed of light when two objects or leave the relative motion, gravitation formula can be introduced through mass-energy equation,
