title: 场存在一个向量属性
categories: blog
---

根据波粒二相性可以推测：所有场都有向量属性，包括电磁场和引力场。
这个向量属性表现为单粒存在方向，即如果我们把场当成粒子的组成时，单个粒子存在一个朝向，使得粒子看起来是个椭圆形，而不是圆形

这个椭圆形在同一个场中表现为同一个朝向。当场的这个向量属性方向不一致时，两个场之间会产生干扰

这也是粒子间存在引力的原因

目前数学推导唯一结论是：
假设当两个物体以光速向相运动或离开时，通过万有引力公式可推出质能方程，

Google Tanslate English:
According to wave-particle two-phase nature can speculate: All games have a vector attributes, including electromagnetic and gravitational fields.
This vector is expressed as a single particle properties direction exists, i.e., as if we field composed of particles, the particles there is a single orientation, such that the particles appear to be oval rather than round

The performance of the oval in the same direction in the same field. Inconsistency on the spot when the direction of this vector property will produce interference between the two fields

This is also the reason for the existence of gravitational force between particles

The only conclusion is that the current mathematical derivation:
Assuming the speed of light when two objects or leave the relative motion, gravitation formula can be introduced through mass-energy equation,
